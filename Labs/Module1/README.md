6. Type a clear prompt or question and press Enter (or click Send).

**Example prompt**
```text
You are an expert teacher skilled in developing detailed lesson plans that are meaningfully connected to learning outcomes for your students. Your task is to generate a list of 5 lesson objectives for my fifth grade science class on gravity. Each objective should begin with “Students will be able to” and align to the 5th grade Next Generation Science Standards. 
```

7. Review response; refine or ask follow‑ups.
8. Use conversation history (if signed in) to revisit answers.

## 4. Writing an Effective First Prompt
- Be specific: “Summarize this paragraph for grade 8 level.”
- Provide context: “You are helping prepare a lesson on ecosystems.”
- Define format: “Return a bullet list of 5 key points.”
- Iterate: Refine after each reply.

## 5. Benefits: Signed In vs Not Signed In

| Aspect | Not Signed In (Guest) | Signed In |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Access stability | Session may reset | Persistent history |
| Conversation history | Usually lost on tab close | Saved & resumable |
| Personalization | None | Adapts to previous context |
| Rate limits | Stricter | Higher allowance |
| Advanced features | Often restricted | Broader (files, plugins, integrations) |
| Device sync | No | Yes across devices |
| Data control | Minimal settings | Account-level privacy controls |

## 6. Privacy & Safety Basics
- Avoid entering sensitive personal data.
- Verify factual or legal claims independently.
- Cite original sources for educational material.

## 7. When to Refresh or Reset
- Model seems “stuck” or off-topic.
- Large context shifts (start a new chat).
- Response limit reached (wait or clear).

## 8. Quick Troubleshooting
- Page not loading: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R).
- Stale output: Rephrase prompt; add context.
- Long or cut reply: Ask “Continue” or “Summarize instead.”

## 9. Example Starter Prompts
- “Explain supervised vs unsupervised learning for a beginner.”
- “Create 5 discussion questions about renewable energy for high school.”
- “Rewrite this paragraph in simpler language: …”
- “List pros and cons of using AI-generated lesson materials.”

## 10. Next Steps
- Experiment with prompt styles (role + task + context + format).
- Compare answers between tools for completeness.
- Build a personal prompt library.

## 11. Minimal Prompt Template
Role: “You are an assistant helping educators.”
Task: “Generate a concise summary.”
Context: “Topic: photosynthesis basics.”
Format: “Return bullet list of 5 points.”

Combine:
“You are an assistant helping educators. Generate a concise summary. Topic: photosynthesis basics. Return bullet list of 5 points.”

## 12. Safe Classroom Use Tips
- Use AI for drafting, not final grading decisions.
- Encourage students to fact-check and cite sources.
- Discuss academic integrity (AI as support, not replacement).

Ready to explore: pick one tool, sign in for persistence, start with a structured prompt, iterate.

## Let's practice using prompts
Each version builds in complexity and clarity, with a focus on lesson design, NGSS alignment, and instructional strategy appropriate for 9th grade Earth science.

**🔹 Prompt 1: Idea generation (open-ended)**

Prompt:
```text
You are an expert 9th grade science teacher. Come up with 3 lesson ideas for a unit on Earth science. The lessons should build on each other and focus on topics like plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, cyclones, tsunamis, floods, landslides, and topography. Each lesson should be 40 minutes long and appropriate for 9th grade students.
```

**💡 Purpose of the prompt:**
Establish a creative baseline. This prompt is intentionally broad, encouraging general idea generation without requiring a detailed structure.

**🔹 Prompt 2: Add Instructional Components**

```text
You are an expert 9th grade science teacher. Create 3 connected lesson plans for a 9th grade Earth science unit. Each lesson should be 40 minutes long and focus on one or more of the following: plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, cyclones, tsunamis, floods, landslides, and topography.
Each lesson plan should include:

A specific topic focus

Learning objectives

A list of key vocabulary

A short outline that includes direct instruction, an engaging activity, and a closure or summary of learning
```

**💡 Purpose of the prompt:**
Adds essential structure for lesson planning. Still flexible, but pushes the AI to think in terms of lesson flow and learning targets.

**🔹 Prompt 3: Include NGSS Standards & Assessment**

```text
You are an expert 9th grade science teacher. Develop 3 sequential, 40-minute Earth science lesson plans that align with NGSS high school standards. Topics should include plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, cyclones, tsunamis, floods, landslides, and topography.
Each lesson must include:

NGSS performance expectations or standard codes

Clear learning objectives

Key vocabulary

A lesson outline with:

Brief direct instruction

A hands-on or inquiry-based activity

A closure that summarizes student learning

A method for assessing student understanding (formative or summative)
```

**💡 Purpose of the prompt:**
Introduces rigor and accountability by requiring standards alignment and assessment, moving the AI closer to producing instructionally sound materials.

**🔹 Prompt 4: Emphasize Cohesion, Purpose, and Reflection**

```text
You are an expert 9th grade science teacher. Design 3 sequential Earth science lesson plans, each 40 minutes long, for a unit focused on topics such as plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, cyclones, tsunamis, floods, landslides, and topography. Lessons must build upon one another to develop a comprehensive understanding of Earth’s dynamic systems.
Each lesson should:

Align to specific NGSS high school standards (e.g., HS-ESS2-1, HS-ESS3-1)

Include clear and measurable learning objectives

Target essential academic vocabulary

Provide a lesson structure with:

Brief direct instruction (max 10 minutes)

A student-centered, engaging activity (hands-on, simulation, data analysis, etc.)

A closure that includes reflection, synthesis, or real-world application

Include a formative or summative assessment
Also explain how each lesson connects to the previous one and contributes to the overall goals of the unit.
```

**💡 Purpose of the prompt:**
This is the final, fully enhanced prompt—clear, rigorous, and instructionally rich. It asks for cohesion across lessons, depth of student engagement, and real-world relevance while staying aligned to standards.
