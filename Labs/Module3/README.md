### Step 1: AI-Assisted Assessments
**AI-Assisted Assessment Prompt**

You are an expert educator and curriculum writer, skilled at developing thoughtful and creative assessments that effectively evaluate your students’ learning. Your task is to design an assessment to evaluate what [GRADE LEVEL AND SUBJECT] students have learned in our unit on [TOPIC]. Follow these directions:

Include questions about: [SPECIFIC CONTENT]. 

Act as a brainstorming partner and make the assessment collaborative. 

Include elements like feedback mechanisms, role-playing, and peer teaching so my students can incorporate an AI chatbot in their assessment. 

The AI chatbot is only to be used to creatively enhance the students’ learning experience; do not include instructions for the chatbot to research information or fact check [SPECIFIC TOPIC].

**Example Prompt:**

```text
You are an expert educator and curriculum writer, skilled at developing thoughtful and creative assessments that effectively evaluate your students’ learning. Your task is to design an assessment to evaluate what my 8th grade social studies class students have learned in our unit on The Great Depression and The New Deal. Follow these directions:

Include questions about: their historical context and causes; cultural responses; and any societal and political effects and consequences. 

Act as a brainstorming partner and make the assessment collaborative. 

Include elements like feedback mechanisms, role-playing, and peer teaching so my students can incorporate an AI chatbot in their assessment. 

The AI chatbot is only to be used to creatively enhance the students’ learning experience; do not include instructions for the AI chatbot to research information or fact check historical events.
```

**Additional Prompting Strategies**

Have the chatbot tailor the assessment to your students’ needs. Include specific standards for your grade/class, ask for questions to be more/less challenging, have the chatbot make the assessment a specific duration of time, etc. 

Ask the chatbot to include specific questions if you already have ideas. For example, “Have the chatbot role play with my students as FDR; the chatbot will be the former president and students can ask him questions about his experience.”  

Enlist the chatbot to make the assessment more relatable to your students or to your demographic. Ask, “Can you make this more relevant for 14 year olds who live in a major city and are interested in social media and video games?” 

Use the chatbot for ideas to incorporate multidisciplinary assessment questions. In this example, students could write historical fiction set in the Great Depression, they could evaluate the economic impact, analyze migration patterns, create and study artwork from that era, etc.

### Step 2: Rubric Prompt

**Rubric Prompt**

You are an expert teacher and curriculum writer, skilled in creating assessments and evaluating student work. Your task is to create a rubric for my [GRADE LEVEL AND SUBJECT] class studying [TOPIC]. My students are completing [ASSIGNMENT TITLE], in which they [ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION]. Format the rubric as a chart and include a 5 point scale. 

**Example Prompt**

```text
You are an expert teacher and curriculum writer, skilled in creating assessments and evaluating student work. Your task is to create a rubric for my 5th grade science class studying engineering. My students are doing a STEM experiment, the “egg drop challenge,” in which they use specific materials to design and build a container to protect the egg from cracking as it is dropped from increasingly higher heights. Format the rubric as a chart and include a 5 point scale.
```

### Setp 3: Rubric for AI-Assisted Assignment

Act as an experienced [TYPE OF TEACHER], skilled at giving targeted, actionable feedback with expertise in using generative AI in the classroom. Create a [#] point rubric for my [GRADE LEVEL AND SUBJECT} that assesses [ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION]. Take into account in the rubric that the students were allowed to use generative AI for [DESCRIPTION OF TASKS STUDENTS CAN USE GENAI]. Include a criteria on the appropriate citing of generative AI using [CITATION STYLE].

**Example Prompt**

```text
Act as an experienced high school English teacher, skilled at giving targeted, actionable feedback with expertise in using generative AI in the classroom. Create a 4 point rubric for my 11th grade English class that assesses a presentation on rhetorical devices in famous political speeches from the 21st century. Take into account in the rubric that the students were allowed to use generative AI for initial brainstorming, refining their ideas, and creating imagery. Include a criteria on the appropriate citing of generative AI using MLA format.
```

**Additional Prompting Strategies**

Enlist the chatbot to include which criteria you’d like to include in your rubric - the more specific you can be in your prompt, the better. In the egg example you could say, “Include design, creativity, presentation, and 2 other categories for a total of 5 criteria students will be evaluated on.”  

Have the chatbot change the format of the rubric to a list or checklist depending on what works best for your assignment.

Ask the chatbot for help in the next step, as well. Use it to create feedback for students who may have struggled with the project, particularly in specific categories. 

Use the chatbot to generate the rubric in advance and pass it out to students. If there is a particular area students seem unprepared for, as a class, have the chatbot generate ideas for how they can practice and prepare.

Include key concepts, vocabulary terms, and make sure to cover all parts of the chapter. Provide a word bank for students, and an answer key for the teacher. 
```

Additional Prompting Strategies

Ask the chatbot to modify anything it creates to ensure that it is perfect for your students. In this example you could ask, "Add 10 more questions," "Make the questions more challenging," "Make the responses have 5 options instead of 4," "Make the quiz more relatable to 12 year old students" etc.”

Use specific learning objectives if you have them. You can say, “Make sure each question aligns to these learning objectives.” 

Enlist the chatbot to help create study guides or other materials to help students study and prepare for the quiz. "Create a study guide to help my 5th grade students prepare for this quiz."

Ask the chatbot how it can help you make the quiz more accessible to students with special needs. 

Have the chatbot help you create feedback, such as model answers for any open-ended questions, or correct answer explanations, or even a rubric for a more detailed assessment.
