# Lab: Crafting Effective AI Prompts for Communications

## Lab Objective

Design an AI prompt that produces accessible, family‑friendly communication assets (email responses, newsletters, Parent Night curriculum presentation, school updates) using clear headings, plain language, defined key terms, and inclusivity features (alt text cues, translation-ready structure) to strengthen equitable family engagement and understanding of STEM learning.

Success indicators: consistent accessibility elements across all asset types; readability at target level; positive family feedback on clarity; evidence of increased engagement (opens, responses, event attendance).

### Lab Outcomes

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Design an AI prompt that produces multiple family‑facing STEM communication assets (email replies, newsletter blurbs, curriculum night slide outline, school update) with consistent structure and accessibility.
- Ensure plain, explicit definitions for key terms, clear headings, and alt‑text cue placeholders.
- Incorporate inclusivity and translation‑ready features (logical section order, short sentences, no embedded images without described purpose).
- Embed measurable success indicators (readability at target level, consistent accessibility elements, positive clarity feedback, improved engagement metrics: opens, responses, attendance).
- Specify evaluation steps to iteratively refine the prompt using family feedback and performance data.
- Produce a reusable, adaptable prompt template that can be quickly tailored to new STEM topics while preserving equity and accessibility standards.
- Identify and correct gaps (missing headings, undefined terms, inaccessible phrasing) before deploying assets generated from the prompt.
- Document a revision checklist to sustain quality across future communication assets.

- Add or change sections based on what you want to focus on most. For example, you could include a section on “School Happenings,” or “School Achievements.”
- Ask the chatbot to compose the school update for any school stakeholder, (e.g., parents, Board of Trustees, teachers, students, community based organizations, etc.). 
- Enlist the chatbot to help you solicit feedback from your audience, particularly if you do not utilize a “call to action” at the end of your update.

**Additional Prompting Strategies**

- Ask the chatbot to add sections at the bottoms of your classroom newsletter like “Reminders,” to remind parents to bring something in, or “Looking Ahead” to call attention to important upcoming dates. 
- Have the chatbot refer to your students in the way that best suits your school. Ask the chatbot to call your classroom “Homeroom 3A,” or to refer to all the students in your school as “friends.” 
- Enlist the help of the chatbot to draft an email to parents if the classroom newsletter will be sent as a pdf/attachment to an email (as opposed to the email itself). For the school newsletter, ask the chatbot to draft an email to teachers each month for information on their recent classroom activities/units.
- Use the chatbot to help you be creative and make both types of newsletters engaging. Ask the chatbot, “I want to make sure parents read the newsletters. What are ways to make the newsletters more interesting or visually appealing?”
